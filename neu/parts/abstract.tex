	This thesis deals with the validation and verification of an extension for the fluid simulation software \gls{bosss} that has been developed at the chair of fluid dynamics at the Technical University of Darmstadt. This extension, namely \gls{cns} solver, is used for the simulation of compressible flows. It is based on a \gls{rkdg} method, a combination of the \gls{fem} and the \gls{fvm}, which is explained in this work. \\\indent
	Furthermore, the simulations described use a mesh that is based on an \gls{ibm}, a method that allows the usage of a very simple rectilinear mesh and a level set which cuts the cells into void and physical region, thus defining a highly parallelisable and easily generated grid. \\\indent
	After the presentation of the \gls{ibm} we verify the \gls{cns} solver for Euler equations concerning robustness and convergence. The results show that the calculations are robust concerning different cell agglomerations for moderately high orders and have a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(h^{P+1})$.\\\indent
	The main part of this thesis deals with the evaluation of the \gls{cns} solver with immersed boundaries for viscid flows using the example of a \gls{2d} cylinder for different Reynolds numbers in the laminar steady and the vortex shedding regime. It shows a good accuracy for high-order calculations even on the coarsest meshes.
