\chapter{Introduction}
The chair of fluid dynamics of the technical university Darmstadt deals mainly with research in fluid mechanical problems, e.g. multiphase flows, turbulence or thermodynamics. In recent years they have been developing \gls{bosss}, a  software using a \gls{rkdg} method for simulation of both incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes, that is highly parallelizable and allows distinct grid types and dimensions (\gls{2d}, \gls{3d}) and arbitrarily defined polynomial order. \\\\
In this thesis we will concentrate on a \gls{2d} grid that is based on a \gls{ibm}. The \gls{bosss} code in combination with \gls{ibm} firstly needs to be validated concerning incompressible Navier Stokes, which will be done in \ref{eulerVerification}, thus giving a basis for examining the calculations of the compressible Navier Stokes case. \\\\
For both cases we will study the \gls{2d} flow around a cylinder for different mesh sizes and polynomial degrees, varying also the Reynolds number as we are studying the compressible viscous flow in \ref{viscousCylinder}. \\\\
In order to be able to conceive the results which we will get by our simulations, I will first give some theory about the fundamental equations in \ref{fundamentals}, the \gls{rkdg} method in \ref{rkdgm} and the grid type based on the \gls{ibm} in \ref{immersedBoundaries}.
