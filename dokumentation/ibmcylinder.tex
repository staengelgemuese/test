\section{Parametric study of a flow around a cylinder}

	\subsection{Shifting cylinder to change cut cells}
	In the first study regarding the fractionless cylinder, we compare the absolute error of entropy for a dgdegree from $1$ to $3$ along a shift of the centre point of the cylinder from $-0.075$ to $0.075$ at steps of $0.015$. By shifting the cylinder we can consider several cases where the cells would be cut differently and therefore cause different cell agglomerations.
